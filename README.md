# DropNaE: Alleviating Irregularity for Large-scale Graph Representation Learning
An implementation of DropNaE: a novel method to alleviate the irregular neighbor distribution in large-scale graphs by conditionally dropping nodes and edges. Please follow this guideline to verify the performance of DropNaE. Since DropNaE is a once-for-all method performed offline, we have processed all large-scale graphs via DropNaE to generate the train_adj (adjacency matrix for training) files. Therefore, one can directly load the processed adj together with other data of one dataset to witness acceleration of training GNNs straightforwardly. The code will be released soon.
